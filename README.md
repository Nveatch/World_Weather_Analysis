# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to use APIs to gather weather information and produce three deliverables:

1. From 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. Then retrieve the current weather description for each city and create a dataframe from the data

2. Create a customer travel destinations map using input statements to retrieve their weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels, and show them as pop-up markers on  a map

3. Create a travel itinerary map that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations
